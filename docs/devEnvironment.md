## Quick start
It is important that you have WSL 2 ready and configured. Every command executed in this section **has to be executed inside linux filesystem.** I recommend opening a new wsl terminal and simply typing _cd ~_ to go into your linux home folder.

!!! warning "Everything beyond this point assumes that you are executing commands on your linux filesystem."
