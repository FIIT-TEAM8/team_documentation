# Password management
Download keepass ZIP file located in the root of our Google Drive. Unzip the contents wherever you like and launch the **KeePass.exe** executable.

To open our password vault, click on **File -> Open -> Open URL**. In the URL field, enter the following value:

```
scp://team08-21.studenti.fiit.stuba.sk/home/fiitkar/.keepass/kps.kdbx
```

In the username and password field, please enter the SSH credentials for the user **fiitkar**. After that you can select whether you want to be prompted for this login next time.

After clicking OK you should be prompted for the vault password. Enter the master password and you should be able to view our password vault. 

If you add a new record, simply save the password vault with **ctrl+s**. This change will automatically synchronize to our team server.
